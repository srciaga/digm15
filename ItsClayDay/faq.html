                            <br>-Shipping rates depend on size, quantity of pieces ordered and delivery location.
                            <br>-If you live in the Bay Area and would like to pick up your order, please notify in the
                            Customer
                            Notes
                            that is available during checkout. Pre-charged shipping costs will then be refunded and pick
                            up
                            date
                            will be arranged.

                            <br><br><strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong>
                            <br>Currently, I do not ship internationally, but am working on making this available for
                            the
                            future.

                            <br>All products are carefully made by hand with stoneware clay unless stated otherwise.
                            Items
                            are
                            dishwasher and microwave safe, but hand washing is recommended to ensure that your pieces
                            remain
                            in mint
                            conditions.

                            <strong>Do you take commissions?</strong>
                            <br>Reach and ask! If it is something that could be made within my style or technique, I'd
                            be
                            happy
                            to
                            consider it.

                            <br><br><strong>When do you update the shop?</strong>
                            <br>There is no set schedule that is consistent. I mainly create small-batches which often
                            come
                            in
                            waves. I
                            try my best to announce when those small-batches will be available via its.clay.day
                            Instagram
                            page.
